# dotfiles

Using dotfiles to manage my setup https://dotfiles.github.io/
There are two different yaml files in the repo, one for my devbox and one for my mac laptops.  

My environment includes:  
* (Vundle)[https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim]  
* (Powerline shell)[https://github.com/banga/powerline-shell]  

Steps:  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Get (Vundle)[https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim] and setup by installing  ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim  
3. Setup the dotfiles by running the `./install` script (change yaml file inside script if necessary)  
3. Launch vim and run :PluginInstall
